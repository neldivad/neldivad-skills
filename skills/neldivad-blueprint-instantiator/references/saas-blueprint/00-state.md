  INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI:
  This is the AUTOSAVE — always current, always lean.
  It answers only 3 questions: Where are we? What's next? What's the handoff?

  HISTORY goes in 00-session-log.md (can be truncated).
  CHECKPOINTS go in saves/ (permanent snapshots at review gates).
  This file stays small enough to always fit in context.

3. Populate `00-variables.md` and `01-prd.md`
4. Run `01-mvp-reduction-checklist.md`
5. Human approves → save gate-1 → Phase 2

## Handoff (for next AI)

Blueprint template system is complete (21 files + saves/ directory).
