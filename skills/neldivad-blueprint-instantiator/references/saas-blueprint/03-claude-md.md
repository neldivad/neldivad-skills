  Replace all {{VARIABLES}} with values from 00-variables.md.
  Place the output at: {{PROJECT_NAME}}/CLAUDE.md

  Update this file whenever the project architecture changes.
  The CLAUDE.md file in the project should always match this template.

## Blueprint Files

This project was generated from a blueprint system. The following files
are the source of truth for architecture decisions:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| 01-prd.md | What we're building and why |
| 02-stack.md | Every technology choice with justification |
| 02-file-tree.md | Complete file structure |
| 02-auth-flow.md | Authentication architecture |
| 02-payment-flow.md | Subscription and billing flows |
| 02-api-routes.md | Every API endpoint |
| 02-schema.md | Database schema |
| 02-pages-and-components.md | UI page map and component inventory |
| 02-risk-registry.md | Known risks and mitigations |
| 02-test-strategy.md | How to test |
| 03-milestones.md | Current progress and next steps |

**Rule: If you need to change the architecture, update the blueprint
file FIRST, then change the code.**
