# Phase 1 Q&A Script
<!-- version: 0.1 | phase: 1 | last-updated: YYYY-MM-DD -->

<!--
  INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI:
  Run through these questions with the human during Phase 1.
  Don't ask all at once — group them into rounds.
  After each round, summarize what you heard and push back if something sounds off.
  Goal: populate 00-variables.md and 01-prd.md by the end.

## Round 1: The Elevator Pitch

Ask these first. Get the big picture before drilling down.

1. **What does this product do in one sentence?**
   → Populates: `{{ONE_LINER}}`, `{{PROJECT_NAME}}`

2. **Who is this for? Be specific — not "everyone."**
   → Populates: `{{TARGET_USER}}`

3. **What is the ONE thing the user does in this app?**
   → Populates: `{{CORE_ACTION}}`, `{{CORE_USER_ACTION}}`

4. **How does this make money?**
   → Populates: `{{MONETIZATION_MODEL}}`, `{{SUBSCRIPTION_TYPE}}`

**CTO Checkpoint:** After Round 1, push back.
- Does this already exist? If so, what's the angle?
- Is the target user specific enough to market to?
- Is the core action simple enough for MVP?

## Round 2: The Domain Model

Now understand WHAT the app manages.

5. **What is the main "thing" in this app?** (e.g., invoices, projects, listings, documents)
   → Populates: `{{PRIMARY_ENTITY}}`

6. **What other "things" exist?** (e.g., teams, comments, files, tags)
   → Populates: `{{SECONDARY_ENTITIES}}`

7. **Who are the different types of users?** (e.g., admin, member, viewer, guest)
   → Populates: `{{USER_ROLES}}`

8. **Does each company/team get their own isolated space?** (multi-tenancy)
   → Populates: `{{MULTI_TENANT}}`

**CTO Checkpoint:** After Round 2, push back.
- Are there too many entity types for MVP? Can we cut any?
- Do we really need multiple user roles for v1?
- Multi-tenancy adds complexity — is it day-1 essential?

## Round 3: MVP Scoping

Force minimalism. For each, the human must justify "yes."

9. **Does this need real-time updates?** (live data, collaborative editing, chat)
   → Populates: `{{REALTIME_NEEDED}}`

10. **Does this need background jobs?** (scheduled tasks, async processing, queues)
    → Populates: `{{BACKGROUND_JOBS_NEEDED}}`

11. **Does this need caching?** (high-traffic reads, expensive computations)
    → Populates: `{{CACHING_NEEDED}}`

12. **Does this need an admin panel?** (internal dashboard to manage users/content)
    → Populates: `{{ADMIN_PANEL_NEEDED}}`

13. **Does this need file uploads?** (images, documents, media)
    → Populates: `{{FILE_UPLOAD_NEEDED}}`

14. **Does this need search?** (full-text search, filtering, facets)
    → Populates: `{{SEARCH_NEEDED}}`

15. **Does this need notifications?** (email, push, in-app)
    → Populates: `{{NOTIFICATIONS_NEEDED}}`

**CTO Checkpoint:** After Round 3, push back HARD.
- For every "yes," ask: "Can we launch without this and add it in v1.1?"
- The goal is to get as many "no" answers as possible.
- Reference `01-mvp-reduction-checklist.md` for the full stress test.

## Round 4: Integrations & Constraints

16. **What external services does this need to talk to?**
    → Populates: `{{KEY_INTEGRATIONS}}`

17. **Do you have any stack preferences?** (e.g., "I want to use Supabase" or "I'm on Vercel")
    → Seeds Phase 2 stack decisions

18. **What's your budget for third-party services?** (auth, payments, hosting, email)
    → Constrains Phase 2 vendor choices

19. **Any hard deadlines or launch targets?**
    → Constrains MVP scope

**CTO Checkpoint:** After Round 4, summarize everything.
- Read back the full picture to the human
- Flag any contradictions (e.g., "you said no background jobs but want scheduled emails")
- List open questions that must be resolved before Phase 2

## Post-Q&A Actions

After all rounds are complete:

1. Populate `00-variables.md` with all answers
2. Fill in `01-prd.md` using the gathered information
3. Run `01-mvp-reduction-checklist.md` as a final filter
4. Present the completed PRD to human for approval
5. Only proceed to Phase 2 after human signs off
